# Navis

Navis is a Chrome extension that helps users find scholarships that are the right fit for them efficiently using AI and web scraping features. It would provide an easier way for students to navigate the numerous scholarships available in a centralized platform, where they can save, apply, and keep track of scholarships they are interested in. It is currently in development, however the inspiration came from a UX Designer who had the designs ready. It just needed a developer to bring it to life.

## Tech Stack

This project uses React, TypeScript, and Vite for frontend development, Cohere Command R to retrieve the summarized scholarship information, Node.js and TypeScript for server development, PostgreSQL for the database to store scholarship information, and Figma to integrate UX designs.
