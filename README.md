# Navis

Navis is a Chrome extension that helps users find scholarships that are the right fit for them efficiently using AI and web scraping features. It would provide an easier way for students to navigate the numerous scholarships available in a centralized platform, where they can save, apply, and keep track of scholarships they are interested in. It is currently in development, however the inspiration came from a UX Designer who had the designs ready. It just needed a developer to bring it to life.

## Tech Stack

This project uses React, TypeScript, and Vite to build the end-to-end product, as well as Cohere AI to retrieve the summarized scholarship information. The current next step is to establish a database using PostgreSQL and integrate the Figma designs.
